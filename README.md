###D3 v4 Multiline Graphs (along with a toggle)
Displays the ratings of 5 restaurants received between the hours 9-22(24 hr format)  
Uses randomly generated colours for each restaurant. Toggle lines via the legend.
Can be scaled for 20-25 data points for 10 restaurants.  
(Did not want to create lots of fake data)

NOTE - When dealing with multiple ratings provided at the same time, one way out is to take an average of those rating ratings and plot that average.
